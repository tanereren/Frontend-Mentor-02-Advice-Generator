## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was great to practice using the fetch method for API calls as well as creating HTML elements straight from the javascript document.
I focused on the project using a mobile-first approach although the design was simple enough to not require much effort to make it responsive.

### Continued development

I'd like to incorporate different APIs in future projects as well as create more complex designs. 
These simple projects are helping me get acquainted with frontendmentor, which seems to be an excellent resource for practicing and improving my skills.
